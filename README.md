# City Graph Visualization

## Overview
A web-based visualization of city graphs with the shortest path calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- D3.js

## Features
- Graph visualization with cities as nodes and roads as links.
- Dropdown selection for source and destination cities.
- Shortest path highlighting between selected cities.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Select source and destination cities.
3. View the shortest path in `graph_view.html`.

## Project Files
- `index.html`: Main page for city selection.
- `graph_view.html`: Visualization page.
- `graph.js`: Graph creation and updating.
- `path_finder.js`: Shortest path logic and Dijkstra's algorithm.
- `styles.css`: Styling for the project.
